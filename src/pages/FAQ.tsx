        question: "How long does it typically take to complete a project?",

      },
      {
        question: "What's included in the final delivery?",
        answer: "All projects include high-resolution files in multiple formats (PNG, JPG, and source files when applicable), commercial usage rights, and a basic style guide. Premium packages include additional formats like SVG, AI, and comprehensive brand guidelines."
      },
      {
        question: "Do you offer unlimited revisions?",
        answer: "Revision policy varies by package. Basic packages include 2-3 revisions, Standard packages include 5 revisions, and Premium packages offer unlimited revisions. Additional revisions beyond the package limit are $25 each."

        question: "Do you offer refunds?",

  {
    category: "Design Process",
    questions: [
      {
        question: "What information do you need to start a project?",
        answer: "I need your brand/channel name, target audience, style preferences, any existing brand elements, preferred colors, and 2-3 reference examples of designs you like. The more details you provide, the better I can match your vision."
      },
      {
        question: "Can I request specific changes during the design process?",
        answer: "Absolutely! Collaboration is key to great design. You can request changes to colors, fonts, layouts, or any other elements during the revision phase. I encourage feedback to ensure the final design exceeds your expectations."
      },
      {
        question: "What if I don't like any of the initial concepts?",
        answer: "This rarely happens, but if none of the initial concepts hit the mark, I'll create new concepts based on your feedback at no extra charge. Your satisfaction is my priority, and I'll work until we find the perfect solution."

      },
      {
        question: "Can I use the designs for commercial purposes?",
        answer: "Yes! All designs come with full commercial usage rights. You own the final design and can use it however you like - on products, marketing materials, websites, etc. I retain the right to showcase the work in my portfolio unless you request otherwise."
      },
      {
        question: "Will my designs work on social media platforms?",
